badkismati se aaj meri tumse shaadi ho gayi thi.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,100

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,520

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:20,180

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,340

18
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,600
Tu pichle hafte Goa gaya tha?

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,820
Tu bhi pagal hogaya kya?

20
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,480
See, your Goa photos.

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,000
tumne mere jeene ki azaadi chheen rakhi thi.

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,660
humne thoda sa paisa kya maang liya tha?

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,180
tumne to mujhe apna ghulam samajh liya.

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,440
Galat to mere sath bhi bahut kuch hua hai.

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,980
so we all together made a plan to play with your mind.

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,040
aur tum haar gaye.

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,800
